Hi I'm Darren, but I'm also known as Dabbo within my gaming hobbies. 

My hobbies are focused around gaming, from playing AAA titles, competitive gaming, etc. to retro games from my childhood, such as the ZX Spectrum and Nintendo/Sega consoles.

I'm also into some electronics (novice) and learning Z80 assembly in preperation to recieving my Spectrum Next (Kickstarter 2 campaign).

Career wise, I've mostly focused on Java development, but I've also touched C#/DotNet, Pyhon, JavaScript frameworks, Android development (Java), LUA scripting, SQL and some other lesser know platforms over the years.

Currently learning Z80 assembly language and Python to sharpen my skills and hopefully produce a Spectrum Next game in the near future.

I started programming at the age of 12, using BASIC on my ZX Spectrum +2A 128K machine.  I then moved onto QBasic and then onto VisualBasic, writing games for myself and my friends to play during college.

I don't really do social media, apart from LinkedIn for my career purposes.  You can find me on there or using Discord.
